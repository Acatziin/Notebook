# Write a program to find anagrams in a given list of words. 
# Two words are called anagrams if one word can be formed by rearranging letters of another. 
# For example ‘eat’, ‘ate’ and ‘tea’ are anagrams.  (use filter function)

#EXAMPLE: 

anagrams(['eat', 'ate', 'done', 'tea', 'soup', 'node']) [['eat', 'ate', 'tea], ['done', 'node'], ['soup']]
